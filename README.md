- 👀 I’m interested in all programming languages, frameworks, and code structure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN Stack, C++, Tree-based algorithms
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on a professional project, but cannot reveal details.
- My greatest skill is in application development and user-interface such as buttons, forms, controls, selectors, state machines.
- I have built and maintained numerous applications from a full-stack scope and I am very efficient in this scope,
but I am even more efficient with compartmentalization such as working with a front end scope from a backend endpoint or API.
- My greatest interest is in optimization of algorithmic logic especially within the scope of video game development.
